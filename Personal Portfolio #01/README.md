In this tutorial ([Open in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQOKRfPAzG0&feature=youtu.be)), I'm going to show you how to use modern **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React** to create a completely **responsive Portfolio Design with Scroll To Element functionality**.  

We'll be using:  
- CSS Grid  
- CSS Flexbox  
- Media Queries for responsive design  
- CSS Transitions for smooth animations
